## Get to Know the Author
**Andrew Jones**
is a principal engineer at GoCardless, one of Europeâ€™s leading Fintech's. He has over 15 years experience in the industry, with the first half primarily as a software engineer, before he moved into the data infrastructure and data engineering space. Joining GoCardless as its first data engineer, he led his team to build their data platform from scratch. After initially following a typical data architecture and getting frustrated with facing the same old challenges heâ€™d faced for years, he started thinking there must be a better way, which led to him coining and defining the ideas around data contracts. Andrew is a regular speaker and writer, and he is passionate about helping organizations get maximum value from data.
